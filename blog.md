# PEN-300 OSEP Blog
This is a blog to put thoughts, feedback, frustrations, and the like as I work through OffSec's PEN-300 and prep for OSEP. I always found detailed blogs and feedback from other students useful while pursuing OSCP and ye olde OSCE, so I thought I'd put this on my GH so others can get a feel for this new course.

*Note: I am making every effort to not reveal any info I shouldn't in this doc. If you see anything that you think shouldn't be included in here, esp if it could possibly breach OffSec's academic integrity policy, please let me know ASAP and I will modify.*

## Overall Notes
- I wish it would have at least touched on macOS and/or cloud, considering many newer companies have one or both of those (sometimes with no Windows footprint at all).

## Course Sections
### 1. Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses: General Course Information
Overview of the course was typical. I like how they defined pentest (external vs internal) and red team engagement. I'm sure some would disagree with their definitions but I liked the clarity of what they said.

### 2. Operating System and Programming Theory
Fairly basic programming info towards the beginning. Not meant to be anything groundbreaking. But good for folks who don't have a strong coding background (like me). Gives plenty of wiki links for more info.
