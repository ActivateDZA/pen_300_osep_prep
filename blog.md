# PEN-300 OSEP Blog
This is a blog to put thoughts, feedback, frustrations, and the like as I work through OffSec's PEN-300 and prep for OSEP. I always found blogs and feedback from other students useful while pursuing OSCP and ye olde OSCE, so I thought I'd put this on my GH so others can get a feel for this new course.

*Note: I am making every effort to not reveal any info I shouldn't in this doc. If you see anything that you think shouldn't be included in here, esp if it could possibly breach OffSec's academic integrity policy, please let me know ASAP and I will modify.*

Got materials at 19:00. Began organizing VMs, info, connectivity, and parsed through syllabus. Looking good so far.
